      In 1960, Martin Luther King, Jr. said on NBC's Meet the Press, “It is one of the tragedies of our nation, one of the shameful tragedies, that 11 o’clock on Sunday mornings is one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America." 
    </p>

    <p>
      Though MLK was referencing church-goers, many classical musicians find his words transferable.</p> 

    <p>
      “Howard Herring, President of the New World Symphony, says to us that Saturday night could be the most segregated time in America,” said Michael Martin, 25, a Black double bassist and fellow at the New World Symphony.</p>

    <p>
      Not only do Black musicians make up less than 2% of the nation’s orchestras, according to a report by the League of American Orchestras, but the structural racism within classical music also permeates concert programs.</p>

    <p>
      Since George Floyd’s death, orchestras around the country have scrambled to program composers of color, but listeners and musicians alike are skeptical as to why programmatic representation has been so abysmal in the past, and whether orchestras are committed to a future of racial justice.</p> 

    <p>
      Data gathered from recent programs by The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra and Philadelphia Orchestra show an unsurprising yet profound story of programmatic segregation. </p>

  <iframe title="In 2019-2020, five of the top U.S. orchestras featured marked differences in programming non-white composers and women and/or trans composers" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-8pwOP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8pwOP/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="657"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

    <p>
      Although the CSO ranked above the New York Philharmonic in the percentage of concerts in its 2019 to 2020 season that featured composers of color, when programs are analyzed by category the result is different.</p>

    <p>
      As Herring's observation indicates, orchestras tend to have their largest audiences on Saturday nights. These programs, categorized as <em>main</em> programs, show a deeper level of segregation.</p> 

    <p>
      “An orchestra’s largest audience is typically on Friday and Saturday nights. If that’s not when living composers, female composers and composers of color are programmed, then a huge number of listeners aren't going to hear them,” said Luke Lentini, 25, a violinist and fellow at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago.</p>

   <iframe title="The CSO had the lowest percentage of main programs that featured non-white composers in 2019-2020" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-V6WbD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V6WbD/17/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="613"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

    <p>
      When programming is broken down by categories, the percentage of CSO programs that featured composers of color decreases. One of the reasons for this change is the segregation of minority composers to their own programs, such as the Cleveland Orchestra programming in 2019 to 2020 only three unique concerts featuring non-white composers and planning one of those concerts in celebration of MLK. 

    <p> 
      "Having an event for women or Black composers is tokenism to a tee," Lentini said.
      
    <p>
      Though the CSO, Cleveland Orchestra and Boston Symphony Orchestra saw decreases in the percentage of unique main concerts featuring non-white composers, the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra saw increases. The reasons for these differences concern not only how often non-white composers are programmed, but also with whom they are programmed.</p>

    <p>
      Some orchestras, like the CSO, have new music series, in which women and composers of color are featured with more regularity than at main programs due to the emphasis on living composers. However, the Philadelphia Orchestra, which leads in all three measurements, chooses instead to forego a new music series and program living composers alongside legacy composers with increased frequency. The result is a decrease in programmatic segregation on the most widely performed concerts.</p>
      
      <p>
        The CSO programs over 30 unique main concerts every year, and each main concert is performed multiple times, typically in a combination of evening concerts and matinees on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. In the CSO's 2019 to 2020 season, there were 102 total main concerts. In 2020 to 2021, there were 103 scheduled main concerts.</p>
    
    <p>
        Though the CSO has improved programming minority composers on their new music series, MusicNow, the series occurs only four times per year and is programmed on Monday nights.</p>
    
    <p>
      “The crowds that come out to contemporary music concerts are not normally huge. When we give contemporary music a chance through separate series, we set it up to fail, or to hurt us in the smallest possible way," Martin said.</p>

   <iframe title="Between 2017 and 2020, the percentage of MusicNow programs that featured non-white composers and women and/or trans composers increased" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-k0qUs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k0qUs/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="251"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

    <p>
      When MusicNow is analyzed by the number of composers featured rather than the number of programs, the change is even more apparent.</p>
    
    <p>
      In 2017, zero of 12 composers were non-white women and two were non-white men; in 2018, two of 17 composers were non-white women and three were non-white men; and in 2019, four of 19 composers were non-white women and two were non-white men.</p>

 <iframe title="CSO's MusicNow series saw an increase in non-white women composers from 2017 to 2020" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LyrbZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LyrbZ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="393"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

    <p>
      Indeed, perhaps one of the most important realizations from this information is that, with only four concerts per year and fewer than 20 composers to feature on each MusicNow series, to increase the number of non-white women composers, the number of other composers, including white men, decreased. </p>

    <p>
      Though the CSO has recognized that increasing one group's representation often means decreasing another's, they are slower to change main concert programs.</p>
    
    <p>
      If Black lives matter to this country's orchestras, then living Black composers must matter, too. The only way to put action to words is to make their music heard. </p>

  <iframe title="Between 2017 and 2021, the CSO's main concerts saw a slight rise in the percentage of programs featuring non-white composers" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jxV4t" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jxV4t/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="415"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

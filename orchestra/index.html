    Classical music is notorious for systemic racism. Where does the Chicago Symphony Orchestra stand?

    In 1960, Martin Luther King, Jr. said on NBC's Meet the Press, “It is one of the tragedies of our nation, one of the shameful tragedies, that 11 o’clock on Sunday mornings is one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America." 
  </p>

  <p>
    Though MLK was referencing church-goers, many classical musicians find his words transferable.</p> 

  <p>
    “Howard Herring, President of the New World Symphony, says to us that Saturday night could be the most segregated time in America,” said Michael Martin, 25, a Black double bassist and fellow at the New World Symphony.</p>

  <p>
    Not only do Black musicians make up less than 2% of the nation’s orchestras, according to a report by the League of American Orchestras, but the structural racism within classical music also permeates concert programs.</p>
  
   <p>
     “When we think about how we define classical music, it minimizes Black participation. It isn’t that there was no participation by African Americans in classical music. It’s that we don’t bring them into the conversation when we talk about what classical music is," said Fredara Hadley, professor of ethnomusicology at Juilliard.</p>

  <p>
    Since George Floyd’s death, orchestras around the country have scrambled to program composers of color, but listeners and musicians alike are skeptical as to why programmatic representation has been so abysmal in the past, and whether orchestras are committed to a future of racial justice.</p> 

  <p>
    Data gathered from recent programs by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra and New York Philharmonic shows an unsurprising yet profound story of programmatic segregation. </p>
  
  <h2>
    Five of the top U.S. orchestras show marked differences in their programming of non-white composers
  </h2>

</script>

  <p>
    Although the CSO ranked above the New York Philharmonic in the percentage of concerts in its 2019 to 2020 season that featured non-white composers, when programs are analyzed by category the result is different.</p>
  
  <h2>
    When main programs are analyzed, the CSO ranks last in racial representation
  </h2>

 <iframe title="Percentages of 2019-2020 main programs that featured non-white composers" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-n9L2s" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n9L2s/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="494"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

  <p>
    As Herring's observation indicates, orchestras tend to have their largest audiences on Saturday nights. These programs, categorized as <em>main</em> programs, show a deeper level of segregation for many orchestras.</p> 

  <p>
    “An orchestra’s largest audience is typically on Friday and Saturday nights. If that isn't when composers of color are programmed, then a huge number of listeners isn't going to hear them,” said Luke Lentini, 25, a violinist and fellow at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago.</p>
  
  <p>
    When programming is broken down by category, the percentage of CSO programs that featured non-white composers decreases from 9% to 7%. One of the reasons for this change is the segregation of minority composers to special programs, such as the Cleveland Orchestra programming in 2019 to 2020 three unique concerts featuring non-white composers and planning one of those concerts in celebration of MLK.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Similar programmatic segregation can also occur with women composers. The CSO's 2020 to 2021 main series was slated to include 33 unique main programs. Only three of these programs featured women, and, of those three, one was planned in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, a signal to many of tokenism.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>
    Tokenism occurs when you present something that is not representative of a whole as if it is representative of a whole. It's the adding of diversity for the sake of appearance.</p>
    <cite> Michael Martin </cite>
  </blockquote>
    
  <p>
    Though the CSO, Cleveland Orchestra and BSO saw decreases in the percentages of unique main concerts featuring non-white composers, percentages for the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra increased. The reasons for these differences concern not only how often non-white composers are programmed, but also with whom they are programmed&mdash;in other words, whether they are programmed alongside legacy composers or siloed with other marginalized composers.</p>

  <p>
    Some orchestras, like the CSO, have new music series, in which women and composers of color are featured with more regularity than at main programs due to the emphasis on living composers.</p>
  
   <p>
      The CSO programs over 30 unique main concerts every year, each of which is performed multiple times&mdash;typically in a combination of evening concerts and matinees on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In the CSO's 2019 to 2020 season, there were 102 total scheduled main concerts. In 2020 to 2021, there were 103.</p> 
     
  </p>
      In contrast, MusicNow, the CSO's new music series, occurs only four times per year and is programmed on Monday nights.</p>
  
  <p>
    The Philadelphia Orchestra, which led at 19% of programs that featured non-white composers, makes a different choice from the CSO by not relying on a new music series to increase programmatic diversity. Rather, the Philadelphia Orchestra programs living composers, and thus more women and non-white composers, alongside legacy composers with increased frequency. The result is a decrease in programmatic segregation on the most widely performed concerts&mdash;a jump from 19% on all programs to 23% on main programs.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>
    The crowds that come out to contemporary music concerts are not normally large. When we give contemporary music a chance through a separate series, we set it up to fail, or to hurt us in the smallest possible way.</p>
    <cite> Michael Martin </cite>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Though the CSO has improved programming minority composers on MusicNow, the overall number of listeners reached is far fewer, which puts the data below into perspective.</p> 
  
    <h2>
    MusicNow saw an increase in racial representation and gender representation over time, but gender exceeded race

  <h2>
    When gender and race are taken into account, the story unfolds more.
  </h2>
  
  <iframe title="Percentage of MusicNow programs that featured non-white women composers" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-k0qUs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k0qUs/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="196"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>
    
  <p>
    As the percentage of programs that featured marginalized composers increased, the percentage of multiply marginalized composers increased, too. In 2017, zero of 12 composers featured on MusicNow programs were non-white women and two were non-white men; in 2018, two of 17 composers were non-white women and three were non-white men; and in 2019, four of 19 composers were non-white women and two were non-white men.</p>
  
  <h2>
    CSO's MusicNow series saw an increase in non-white women composers from 2017 to 2020
  </h2>

<iframe title="Breakdown of MusicNow composers by gender and race" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LyrbZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LyrbZ/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="367"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

  <p>
    Perhaps one of the most important realizations from this information is that, with only four concerts per year and fewer than 20 composers to feature on each MusicNow series, to increase the number of non-white women composers, the number of other composers, including white men, decreased. </p>

  <p>
    Though the CSO has recognized in MusicNow that increasing one group's representation can mean decreasing another's, they are slower to change main concert programs, where composers such as Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart reign supreme.</p>

    If Black lives matter to U.S. orchestras, then living Black composers must matter, too. The only way to put action to words is to make their music heard. </p>  

  <p>
    “People are creating because there is something to communicate, there is something to put out into the world," Hadley said. "Black Americans are no different from that needing to express and seeing classical music as a viable form to communicate."</p>

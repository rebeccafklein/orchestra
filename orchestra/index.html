    Martin Luther King, Jr. was talking about church-goers in 1960 when he called Sunday mornings, “one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America."
    </p>

    <p>
    Many classical musicians say the same could be said about Saturday nights.
    </p> 

    <p>
    “Howard Herring, President of the New World Symphony, says to us that Saturday night could be the most segregated time in America,” said Michael Martin, 25, a Black double bassist and New World Symphony fellow.     </p>

    <p>
    Not only do Black musicians make up less than 2% of the nation’s orchestras, according to a report by the League of American Orchestras, but the structural racism within classical music also permeates concert programs.     </p>
  
    <p>
     “When we think about how we define classical music, it minimizes Black participation,” said Dr. Fredara Hadley, professor of ethnomusicology at Juilliard. “It isn’t that there was no participation by African Americans in classical music. It’s that we don’t bring them into the conversation when we talk about what classical music is.”
    </p>

    Since George Floyd’s death, 
     <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/arts/music/orchestra-livestreams-black-composers.html" target="_blank">orchestras around the country have scrambled to program Black composers,</a> but musicians alike are skeptical as to why programmatic representation has been so abysmal in the past, and whether orchestras are committed to a future of racial justice.

    Data gathered from recent programs by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra shows an unsurprising yet profound story of programmatic segregation.

    Although the CSO ranked above the New York Philharmonic in the percentage of concerts that featured non-white composers from 2019 to 2020, the result is different when programs are analyzed by category.

    <p>
    As Herring's observation indicates, orchestras tend to have their largest audiences on Saturday nights. These programs, categorized as <em>main</em> programs, show a deeper level of segregation for many orchestras.
    </p> 

    <p>
    “An orchestra’s largest audience is typically on Friday and Saturday nights. If that isn't when composers of color are programmed, then a huge number of listeners isn't going to hear them,” said Luke Lentini, 25, a violinist and Civic Orchestra of Chicago fellow.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    When programming is analyzed by category, the percentage of CSO programs that featured non-white composers decreases by two percentage points in main programs. One of the reasons for this change is the segregation of minority composers to special programs, such as the Cleveland Orchestra programming in 2019 to 2020 three unique concerts featuring non-white composers and planning one of those concerts in celebration of MLK.
    </p> 
  
    <p>
    Main concerts, in which antique composers such as Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart are programmed with frequency, reflect the iron grip with which European influences still hold classical music.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    “What we have to look at is the way America’s concert scene developed in the late 19th century when orchestras began to emerge as autonomous organizations," said Dr. Tammy Kernodle, Professor of Musicology at Miami University and President of the Society for American Music. "Even though we had a robust soundscape in America, we were still beholden to European concert artists and composers in shaping that. It's important that we understand we’ve never really until recently tried to forge a separate cultural identity in America in terms of concert music."
    </p>
  
    <p>
    Similar programmatic segregation can also occur with women composers. The CSO's 2020 to 2021 main series was slated to include 33 unique main programs. Three of these programs featured women and of those three, one was planned in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, a signal to many of tokenism.
    </p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>
    Tokenism occurs when you present something that is not representative of a whole as if it is representative of a whole. It's the adding of diversity for the sake of appearance.       </p>
      <cite> Michael Martin </cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    Though the CSO, Cleveland Orchestra and BSO saw decreases in the percentages of unique main concerts featuring non-white composers, percentages for the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra increased. The reasons for these differences concern not only how often non-white composers are programmed, but also with whom they are programmed&mdash;whether they are programmed alongside legacy composers or siloed with other marginalized composers.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some orchestras, like the CSO, have new music series, in which women and non-white composers are featured with more regularity than at main programs due to the emphasis on living composers.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The CSO programs over 30 unique main concerts every year, each of which is performed multiple times&mdash;typically in a combination of evening concerts and matinees on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In the CSO's 2019 to 2020 season, there were 102 total scheduled main concerts. In 2020 to 2021, there were 103.
    </p> 
     
    <p>
      In contrast, MusicNow, the CSO's new music series, occurs four times per year and is programmed on Monday nights.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    The Philadelphia Orchestra, which led at 19% of programs that featured non-white composers, makes a different choice from the CSO by not relying on a new music series to increase programmatic diversity. Rather, the Philadelphia Orchestra programs living composers, and thus more women and non-white composers, alongside legacy composers with increased frequency. The result is a decrease in programmatic segregation on the most widely performed concerts&mdash;a jump from 19% on all programs to 23% on main programs.
    </p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>
    The crowds that come out to contemporary music concerts are not normally large. When we give contemporary music a chance through a separate series, we set it up to fail, or to hurt us in the smallest possible way.
      </p>
      <cite> Michael Martin </cite>
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>
    Though the CSO has improved programming minority composers on MusicNow, the overall number of listeners reached is far fewer, which puts the data below into perspective.     </p>

    As the percentage of programs featuring marginalized composers increased, so too did the percentage of multiply marginalized composers. In 2017, zero of 12 composers featured on MusicNow programs were non-white women and two were non-white men; in 2018, two of 17 composers were non-white women and three were non-white men; and in 2019, four of 19 composers were non-white women and two were non-white men.

    <p>
    Perhaps one of the most important realizations from this information is that, with only four concerts per year and fewer than 20 composers to feature on each MusicNow series, to increase the number of non-white women composers, the percentage of other composers&mdash;white men&mdash;decreased. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Though the CSO has recognized in MusicNow that increasing one group's representation can mean decreasing another's, they are slower to change main concert programs, where antique European composers reign supreme.

    “We have a decision to make: Are we going to keep playing the same pieces by the same dead white men forever, or are we going to start playing something new and bring this industry into relevance in the 21st century?” Lentini said. “I hope and think the orchestras who rise to prominence in the next decade are the ones who will program more composers of color and more women. It doesn’t mean we will never program Mozart or Beethoven again, but it means they’ll be programmed less.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
    If Black lives matter to U.S. orchestras, then living Black composers must matter, too. The only way to put action to words is to make their music heard. 
    </p>  

    <p>
    “People are creating because there is something to communicate, there is something to put out into the world," Hadley said. "Black Americans are no different from that needing to express and seeing classical music as a viable form to communicate."
